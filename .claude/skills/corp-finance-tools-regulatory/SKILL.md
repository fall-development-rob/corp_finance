## Response Envelope

Every tool returns this structure:

```json
{
  "result": { },
  "methodology": "DCF (FCFF, 2-stage)",
  "assumptions": { },
  "warnings": ["Terminal growth (3.5%) above long-term GDP"],
  "metadata": {
    "version": "0.1.0",
    "computation_time_us": 1200,

## Input Conventions

- **Rates as decimals**: 5% = `0.05`, never `5`
- **Money as raw numbers**: $1M = `1000000`, not `"$1M"`
- **Currency**: specify with `currency` field (default: USD)
- **Dates**: ISO 8601 format (`"2026-01-15"`)
- **Weights must sum to 1.0**: `debt_weight + equity_weight = 1.0`

## Error Handling

Tools return structured errors for:
- **InvalidInput**: field-level validation (e.g., negative beta, weights not summing to 1.0)
- **FinancialImpossibility**: terminal growth >= WACC, negative enterprise value
- **ConvergenceFailure**: IRR/XIRR Newton-Raphson didn't converge (reports iterations and last delta)
- **InsufficientData**: too few data points for statistical calculations
- **DivisionByZero**: zero interest expense for coverage ratios, etc.

Always validate tool error responses and report them clearly to the user.
