## Analysis Workflows

### Restructuring & Distressed Debt Workflow

1. **Recovery analysis**: call `recovery_analysis` with enterprise value, claims, and collateral data
   - Absolute Priority Rule (APR) waterfall: DIP -> admin -> secured -> unsecured -> sub -> equity
   - Going-concern vs liquidation scenarios (liquidation typically 30-60% haircut)
   - Fulcrum security: the class that is partially impaired (recovery < 100%)
   - Collateral deficiency claims: secured shortfall becomes unsecured claim
2. **Distressed debt analysis**: call `distressed_debt_analysis` with debt terms, market prices, and restructuring terms
   - Treatment types: reinstate, amend & extend, exchange, equity conversion, cash paydown, combination
   - IRR at market price: expected return if bought at current trading price
   - Credit bid value: maximum price an asset-based buyer would pay
   - DIP financing analysis: adequate protection, priming liens, professional fees
3. **Cross-check with credit metrics**: call `credit_metrics` on post-restructuring capital structure
4. **Z-Score screening**: call `altman_zscore` to confirm distress zone classification

### Real Assets Workflow

1. **Property valuation**: call `property_valuation` with NOI, cap rate, growth assumptions
   - Direct capitalisation: Value = NOI / Cap Rate (quick single-year valuation)
   - DCF: project NOI growth over hold period + terminal value at exit cap rate
   - Gross rent multiplier: Value = GRM x Gross Rent (quick screening metric)
   - "All" mode: runs all three methods and cross-checks
2. **Leveraged returns**: the tool automatically calculates if mortgage data is provided
   - Amortising mortgage: monthly payment, interest/principal split, remaining balance
   - DSCR: NOI / Debt Service (must be >1.2x for most lenders)
   - Cash-on-cash return: annual cash flow / equity invested
   - Equity multiple: total distributions / initial equity
   - Levered IRR: return on equity accounting for leverage and amortisation
3. **Project / infrastructure finance**: call `project_finance` with construction + operating parameters
   - Construction phase: drawdown schedule, IDC capitalisation, completion milestones
   - Operating phase: revenue ramp-up, O&M costs, debt service, distribution waterfall
   - Debt sculpting methods: level (equal payments), sculpted (sized to target DSCR), bullet (interest-only + balloon)
   - Coverage ratios: DSCR (annual), LLCR (loan life), PLCR (project life)
4. **Sensitivity**: call `sensitivity_matrix` varying cap rate vs NOI growth (property) or revenue vs cost (project)

### Venture Capital Workflow

1. **Model dilution**: call `venture_dilution` with funding rounds
   - Option pool shuffle: pool created pre-money, dilutes founders not the new investor
   - Post-money = pre-money + investment; price per share = post-money / fully diluted shares
   - Track founder ownership decline through multiple rounds
2. **Analyse convertible instruments**: call `convertible_instrument` for SAFEs and convertible notes
   - SAFE: post-money ownership = investment / valuation_cap; no interest, no maturity
   - Convertible note: accrued interest, cap vs discount (investor gets more favorable), maturity conversion
   - MFN (most favored nation) provisions
3. **Fund return analytics**: call `venture_fund_returns` with portfolio data
   - J-curve: negative returns in early years (management fees + unrealised), positive in later years
   - TVPI (total value to paid-in), DPI (distributed), RVPI (residual)
   - Carry calculation: 20% above 8% hurdle (typical)
   - Loss ratio, portfolio concentration, top performer analysis
4. **Key benchmarks**: top quartile VC fund returns ~3.0x+ TVPI, ~25%+ net IRR

   - KPI performance vs targets, margin ratchet adjustments

### Regulatory Capital Workflow

1. **Compute capital adequacy**: call `basel_capital` with exposure data
   - CET1, Tier 1, Total Capital ratios
   - Standardised Approach risk weights by asset class (sovereign, bank, corporate, retail, mortgage) and external rating
   - Operational risk: Basic Indicator Approach (BIA) or Standardised Approach (SA)
   - Credit risk mitigation: financial collateral haircuts
   - Capital buffers: conservation (2.5%), countercyclical (0-2.5%), G-SIB/D-SIB
2. **Assess liquidity**: call `lcr_nsfr` for liquidity compliance
   - LCR >= 100%: HQLA / Net Cash Outflows (30-day stress)
   - HQLA: Level 1 (cash, government), Level 2A (40% cap), Level 2B (15% cap)
   - Inflow cap: 75% of outflows
   - NSFR >= 100%: Available Stable Funding / Required Stable Funding
3. **Model rate risk**: call `alm_analysis` for banking book rate exposure
   - Repricing gap analysis: mismatch between asset and liability repricing
   - NII sensitivity: impact of parallel rate shifts with beta pass-through (deposits reprice slower)
   - EVE (Economic Value of Equity): present value sensitivity to rate changes
4. **Key thresholds**: CET1 > 4.5% (min), > 7% (with buffers); LCR > 100%; NSFR > 100%

### Private Credit Workflow

1. **Price unitranche**: call `unitranche_pricing` with deal terms
   - First-out/last-out split: FO has lower spread (senior-like), LO has higher spread (mezz-like)
   - Blended spread = FO% x FO_spread + LO% x LO_spread
   - OID and fee yield pickup: straight-line over maturity
   - Borrower metrics: total leverage, FO/LO leverage, interest coverage
2. **Model direct loan**: call `direct_lending` with loan structure
   - PIK toggle: interest accrues to principal (increases exposure, defers cash)
   - Delayed draw: commitment fee on undrawn portion
   - Amortisation: interest-only, level amort, bullet, or custom schedule
   - Rate floors: effective_base = max(base_rate, floor_rate)

   - Participant allocations and fee splits
4. **Key benchmarks**: unitranche spreads 400-700bps, leverage 4-6x EBITDA, typical FOLO split 60/40

### Insurance & Actuarial Workflow

1. **Estimate reserves**: call `loss_reserving` with claims triangle
   - Chain-ladder: volume-weighted age-to-age factors -> cumulative development factors -> ultimate losses
   - Bornhuetter-Ferguson: blends a priori expected loss ratio with actual development for immature years
   - Method selection (when "Both"): CL for mature years (>50% developed), BF for immature
   - IBNR = Ultimate - Paid to Date; present value discounting for reserve adequacy
2. **Price premiums**: call `premium_pricing` with loss assumptions
   - Pure premium = frequency x severity
   - Trend projections: apply annual trend factors forward
   - Loaded premium: pure premium + expense loading + profit loading + contingency
3. **Analyse profitability**: call `combined_ratio` with historical periods
   - Loss ratio = incurred losses / earned premium
   - Expense ratio = expenses / written premium
   - Combined ratio = loss + expense (< 100% means underwriting profit)
   - Operating ratio = combined - investment income ratio
4. **Compute capital**: call `solvency_scr` for Solvency II requirements
   - Standard Formula: premium risk + reserve risk with correlation-based diversification
   - Operational risk component
   - MCR floor: SCR can never be below minimum capital requirement
5. **Key benchmarks**: combined ratio < 100% (profitable), chain-ladder R-squared > 0.95, reserve adequacy 100-105%

### FP&A Workflow

1. **Analyse budget variance**: call `variance_analysis` with budget and actual data
   - Revenue decomposition: price variance + volume variance + mix variance = total variance
   - Cost variance: favorable (actual < budget) vs unfavorable, by line item
   - Profit variance with budget and actual margin percentages
   - YoY comparison: revenue growth, profit growth, margin expansion (bps)
2. **Compute break-even**: call `breakeven_analysis` with cost structure
   - Contribution margin = selling price - variable cost per unit
   - Break-even units = fixed costs / contribution margin
   - Degree of Operating Leverage (DOL) = total CM / operating profit
   - Target volume for profit goals
   - Scenario analysis: what-if on price, variable cost, fixed cost changes
3. **Analyse working capital**: call `working_capital` with period data
   - DSO (days sales outstanding), DIO (days inventory outstanding), DPO (days payable outstanding)
   - Cash conversion cycle = DSO + DIO - DPO
   - Trend analysis: improving/deteriorating/stable over time
   - Optimisation: cash freed from efficiency improvements, financing cost savings
   - Peer benchmarking against industry medians
4. **Build forecast**: call `rolling_forecast` with historical data and growth assumptions
   - Revenue projection at compound growth rate
   - COGS/OpEx/CapEx derived from historical averages or driver overrides
   - Free cash flow projection, cumulative FCF, terminal revenue
5. **Key benchmarks**: CCC < 60 days (efficient), DOL > 3x (high operating leverage), margin expansion > 50bps YoY (positive trend)

### Wealth Management Workflow

1. **Plan retirement**: call `retirement_planning` with personal financial data
   - Accumulation phase: savings compound with growth, contributions grow annually
   - Decumulation phase: 4 withdrawal strategies:
     - Constant Dollar: inflation-adjusted fixed amount (classic 4% rule)
     - Constant Percentage: fixed % of portfolio each year (adapts to market)
     - Guardrails: dynamic % with floor and ceiling bands (Guyton-Klinger inspired)
     - RMD: required minimum distribution (balance / remaining years)
   - Savings gap analysis: if projected portfolio < needed, calculate required additional savings
   - Real vs nominal values: all amounts shown in today's dollars
2. **Optimise taxes**: call `tax_loss_harvesting` with portfolio positions
   - Identify candidates: positions with unrealised losses above harvest threshold
   - Short-term vs long-term classification (365-day holding period boundary)
   - Tax savings: offset ST losses against ST gains first (higher rate), then LT
   - Wash-sale rule: 30-day restriction on repurchasing substantially identical securities
   - Carry-forward: excess losses above current gains carried to future years
   - Portfolio impact: new cost basis if reinvested, deferred tax liability
3. **Plan estate**: call `estate_planning` with estate details
   - Gifting analysis: annual exclusion ($18K/person), lifetime exemption usage
   - Trust analysis: 7 types (Revocable, Irrevocable, GRAT, ILIT, QPRT, Crummey, Charitable Remainder)
   - Estate tax: gross estate - deductions (marital, charitable, irrevocable trusts) = taxable estate
   - ILIT: life insurance excluded from gross estate when held in irrevocable trust
   - GST tax: generation-skipping transfer tax on skip-person gifts above exemption
   - Planning strategies: 8 conditional recommendations based on estate composition
4. **Key benchmarks**: 4% withdrawal rate sustainable for 30+ years, TLH adds 50-100bps annually, estate tax rate 40% (federal), annual exclusion $18K (2024+)

### Credit Derivatives Workflow

1. **Price CDS**: call `cds_pricing` with reference entity, spread, recovery, tenor
   - Discrete hazard-rate model: annual survival probabilities from implied PD
   - Risky PV01: present value of 1bp of premium payments (risky annuity)
   - Protection leg: sum of discounted expected default losses
   - Premium leg: sum of discounted coupon payments weighted by survival
   - Breakeven spread: protection_leg_PV / risky_PV01 * 10,000 bps
   - DV01: dollar value of 1bp spread change = risky_PV01 * notional / 10,000
   - Jump-to-default: loss if default happens immediately = notional * (1 - recovery)
   - MTM = (market_spread - contract_spread) * risky_PV01 * notional / 10,000
2. **Compute CVA/DVA**: call `cva_calculation` with exposure profile and default probabilities
   - Unilateral CVA = sum over periods of (marginal PD * LGD * discounted expected exposure)
   - DVA: same calculation using own PD (benefit from own default -- controversial)
   - Bilateral CVA = unilateral CVA - DVA
   - Netting: reduce gross exposure by netting benefit ratio (portfolio-level offset)
   - Collateral: cap exposure at threshold (above threshold is collateralised)
   - CVA as spread: annualise CVA over effective maturity
3. **Key benchmarks**:
   - Investment grade CDS: 20-150bps; high yield: 200-800bps; distressed: 1000+bps
   - CDS-bond basis: CDS spread should roughly equal bond Z-spread (deviations are arbitrage signals)
   - CVA typically 50-300bps for uncollateralised trades with BBB counterparties

### Convertible Bond Workflow

1. **Price convertible**: call `convertible_bond_pricing` with bond terms, stock data, and volatility
   - CRR binomial tree: at each node, CB value = max(hold_value, conversion_value)
   - Hold value = discounted expected future value + coupon
   - Conversion value = stock_price * conversion_ratio
   - Call provision: if issuer can call and CB > call_price, force conversion (cap value at call_price)
   - Put provision: if investor can put, floor value at put_price
   - Bond floor: pure debt value if no conversion (straight bond DCF at credit-adjusted rate)
   - Conversion premium = (CB_price - conversion_value) / conversion_value
   - Investment premium = (CB_price - bond_floor) / bond_floor
   - Greeks via finite differences: bump stock +/-1% for delta/gamma, bump vol +1% for vega, reduce time for theta
2. **Analyse scenarios**: call `convertible_bond_analysis` with scenario parameters
   - Stock sensitivity: CB price across range of stock prices -- convex payoff profile
   - Vol sensitivity: higher volatility increases embedded option value (CB price rises)
   - Spread sensitivity: wider credit spread reduces bond floor component
   - Forced conversion: issuer calls when conversion value exceeds call price (forces holders to convert)
   - Income advantage: coupon yield vs stock dividend yield; breakeven years = premium / yield advantage
   - Risk-return profile: upside participation (delta at +20%), downside protection (bond floor at -20%), asymmetry ratio
3. **Key benchmarks**:
   - Balanced CB: conversion premium 20-40%, delta 0.4-0.6
   - Equity-like CB: conversion premium < 15%, delta > 0.7
   - Bond-like CB (busted): conversion premium > 60%, delta < 0.3
   - Typical breakeven: 2-4 years (yield advantage over stock dividend)

### Lease Accounting Workflow

1. **Classify lease**: call `lease_classification` with lease terms and asset data
   - ASC 842 five tests -- any one triggered = finance lease:
     - Transfer of ownership at lease end
     - Purchase option reasonably certain to be exercised
     - Specialized asset with no alternative use to lessor
     - Lease term >= 75% of economic useful life
     - PV of payments >= 90% of fair value
   - IFRS 16: virtually all leases treated as finance for lessees (no operating classification)
   - ROU asset = PV of payments + initial direct costs + prepayments - incentives
   - Lease liability = PV of payments at incremental borrowing rate (or implicit rate if known)
   - Finance lease: effective interest on liability + straight-line depreciation on ROU (front-loaded expense)
   - Operating lease (ASC 842): single straight-line lease expense (simpler, but still on balance sheet)
2. **Analyse sale-leaseback**: call `sale_leaseback_analysis` with transaction data
   - Qualifying sale (ASC 606): gain = (sale_price - carrying_value) * (1 - retained_right_ratio)
   - Retained right ratio = PV of leaseback / fair_value (deferred portion)
   - Above-FMV: excess price deferred as financing component
   - Failed sale: asset remains on books, proceeds recorded as financing obligation
3. **Key benchmarks**:
   - IBR: typically company's marginal borrowing rate (BBB: 4-6%, BB: 6-9%)
   - Finance vs operating: finance lease has higher expense in early years, lower in later years (total same)
   - Sale-leaseback gain: typically 30-60% recognized immediately (rest deferred over leaseback)

### Pension & LDI Workflow

1. **Analyse pension funding**: call `pension_funding` with plan data
   - PBO (Projected Benefit Obligation): includes future salary growth projections
   - ABO (Accumulated Benefit Obligation): current salaries only (lower than PBO)
   - Unit credit method: PV of earned benefit = accrual_rate * service * final_salary * annuity_factor * discount_factor
   - Funded status = plan_assets - PBO; positive = overfunded, negative = underfunded
   - Funding ratio = plan_assets / PBO (target: >= 100%, required: >= 80% minimum)
   - Service cost = PV of one additional year of benefit accrual
   - Interest cost = discount_rate * beginning_PBO
   - Expected return = expected_ROA * beginning_assets
   - NPPC = service_cost + interest_cost - expected_return (net periodic pension cost)
   - Minimum required contribution: bring funded ratio to minimum_funding_pct
   - Maximum deductible: up to maximum_deductible_pct * PBO
2. **Design LDI strategy**: call `ldi_strategy` with liability and asset data
   - Duration gap = asset_duration - (liability_PV / plan_assets) * liability_duration
   - Dollar duration gap = (asset_dollar_duration - liability_dollar_duration)
   - Interest rate risk (1% shock) = dollar_duration_gap * 0.01
   - Hedging portfolio: allocate to instruments that match liability duration
   - Duration-weighted instrument selection: match target within tolerance
   - Immunization: duration + convexity match (convexity of assets >= convexity of liabilities)
   - Surplus-at-risk = dollar_duration_gap * rate_shock (how much surplus changes per bp)
   - Glide path: as funded ratio improves, shift from growth (equity) to hedging (fixed income)
3. **Key benchmarks**:
   - Healthy funded ratio: > 100%; at-risk: 80-100%; critical: < 80%
   - Duration gap: target < 0.5 years for well-hedged plans
   - LDI completion ratio: 80%+ of liabilities hedged for mature plans
   - NPPC typically 5-15% of payroll for well-funded plans

### Sovereign Risk Workflow

1. **Assess country risk**: call `country_risk_assessment` with macro-economic data
   - 12-factor scoring: GDP growth, inflation, fiscal balance, debt/GDP, current account, FX reserves, political stability, rule of law, external debt, ST debt/reserves, default history, dollarization
   - Composite score maps to implied sovereign rating (AAA through CCC)
   - Country Risk Premium (CRP) for use in cost-of-equity calculations (add to WACC)
   - Default probability implied by CRP level
2. **Price sovereign bonds**: call `sovereign_bond_analysis` with bond terms and sovereign spread
   - Spread decomposition: credit risk, liquidity, FX risk components
   - Local vs hard currency: local currency bonds carry additional inflation and FX risk
   - Duration and convexity for rate sensitivity
3. **Integration with equity valuation**: CRP feeds directly into WACC as an additive premium
   - Developed markets: CRP = 0-50bps
   - Emerging investment grade: CRP = 100-300bps
   - Frontier/distressed: CRP = 400-1000+bps
4. **Key benchmarks**: debt/GDP > 100% = elevated risk; reserves < 3 months imports = vulnerability

### Real Options & Decision Analysis Workflow

1. **Identify real options**: look for managerial flexibility in capital budgeting decisions
   - Expand: option to scale up if successful (e.g., Phase 2 of a project)
   - Abandon: option to exit and salvage assets if unsuccessful
   - Defer: option to wait for more information before committing
   - Switch: option to change operating mode (e.g., fuel type, product mix)
   - Contract: option to scale down operations
   - Compound: option that creates further options (R&D -> commercialisation)
2. **Value real options**: call `real_option_valuation` with project parameters
   - CRR binomial tree: up/down moves calibrated to project volatility
   - Option value = expanded NPV - static NPV (the value of flexibility)
   - Greeks provide sensitivity analysis (delta to underlying, vega to uncertainty)
3. **Decision tree analysis**: call `decision_tree_analysis` for multi-stage decisions
   - EMV rollback: compute expected value at each decision/chance node
   - EVPI: maximum you should pay for perfect information
   - Sensitivity: how optimal decision changes with key probability shifts
4. **Key benchmarks**: real option premium 10-30% of static NPV; use when uncertainty > 30% volatility

### Equity Research Workflow

1. **SOTP valuation**: call `sotp_valuation` for multi-segment companies
   - Value each business segment using the most appropriate method (EV/EBITDA, P/E, EV/Revenue, DCF, NAV)
   - Apply holding company / conglomerate discount (typically 10-25%)
   - Football field: overlay min/base/max from comparable ranges per segment
   - Bridge to equity: total EV - net debt - minorities + unconsolidated investments
2. **Target price derivation**: call `target_price` with per-share metrics and peer data
   - Run all methods simultaneously: PE, PEG, P/B, P/S, DDM
   - Peer-relative: compare subject's implied price across each multiple vs median
   - Football field: visualise range of target prices across methods
   - Recommendation: map upside/downside to Buy/Hold/Sell rating
3. **Cross-check**: compare SOTP implied value with target price methods -- divergence > 20% needs explanation
4. **Key benchmarks**: PEG < 1 = potentially undervalued on growth-adjusted basis; conglomerate discount narrows when spin-off announced

### Commodity Trading Workflow

1. **Analyse processing spreads**: call `commodity_spread` with input/output prices
   - Crack spread (3-2-1): refining margin from crude oil to gasoline + heating oil
   - Crush spread: soybean processing margin (meal + oil - beans)
   - Spark spread: power generation margin (electricity - gas * heat rate)
   - Historical z-score: identify mean-reversion opportunities
2. **Evaluate storage economics**: call `storage_economics` with futures term structure
   - Cash-and-carry: profit = (futures - spot) - (storage + financing + insurance)
   - Implied convenience yield: what the market assigns to physical possession
   - Seasonal patterns: injection/withdrawal cycles (gas), planting/harvest (agriculture)
3. **Calendar spreads**: near-month vs far-month for curve shape trades
4. **Key benchmarks**: crack spread > $15/bbl = strong refining margins; contango > storage cost = arbitrage

### Treasury Management Workflow

1. **Cash management**: call `cash_management` with 12-month cash flow projections
   - Month-by-month simulation: opening cash -> operating flows -> sweep/facility logic -> closing cash
   - Sweep excess to money market when above threshold
   - Draw revolving facility when below minimum buffer
   - Output: peak deficit, investment income, facility cost, net interest, CCC
   - Liquidity score: weighted average of buffer adequacy, facility headroom, CCC
2. **Hedge effectiveness**: call `hedge_effectiveness` for accounting compliance
   - Prospective (before hedge): qualitative assessment + quantitative forecast
   - Retrospective (ongoing): dollar offset within 80-125% AND regression R-squared > 0.80
   - IAS 39: both tests must pass; IFRS 9: more qualitative, R-squared > 0.80 sufficient
   - VaR analysis: compare hedged vs unhedged risk at confidence level

2. **Conduit routing optimisation**: call `conduit_routing` with source, intermediary, and recipient jurisdictions
   - Two-hop analysis: Source -> Intermediary -> Recipient
   - Combined effective rate: 1 - (1 - WHT_source_to_intermediary) * (1 - WHT_intermediary_to_recipient)
   - Optimal jurisdiction selection: minimise combined effective rate across candidate intermediaries
   - Substance requirements at intermediary: office, employees, decision-making, bank accounts
3. **Anti-avoidance provisions**: assess treaty override risks
   - LOB (Limitation on Benefits): US treaty-specific, qualified person tests (publicly traded, ownership/base erosion, active trade, derivative benefits)

   - Digital PE: emerging concept (not yet in OECD model but in some bilateral treaties and domestic laws)
   - Risk scoring: 0-100 composite score across PE categories (>70 = high risk, recommend restructuring)
6. **Key benchmarks**: Netherlands/Luxembourg/Ireland most common EU holding jurisdictions; typical substance cost EUR 50-150k/year; LOB qualified person test pass rate ~60% for non-US multinationals; PPT is now default under MLI (130+ signatories); interest deduction cap 30% EBITDA is EU standard (ATAD Article 4)

2. **CRS (Common Reporting Standard)**: multi-lateral automatic exchange
   - Wider approach: report on all non-resident accounts (most jurisdictions adopt this)
   - Narrower approach: report only on accounts held by residents of partner jurisdictions
   - 100+ participating jurisdictions (notably excluding US, which relies on FATCA bilateral agreements)
   - Due diligence: self-certification for new accounts, indicia search for pre-existing accounts
   - Lower-value (< $1M pre-existing): residence address test or electronic record search
   - Higher-value (>= $1M pre-existing): enhanced review including relationship manager inquiry
3. **Entity classification**: call `entity_classification` with entity details
   - FFI (Foreign Financial Institution): depository, custodial, investment entity, specified insurance company
   - NFFE (Non-Financial Foreign Entity -- FATCA term): active (>50% income from active business AND >50% assets held for active business) or passive
   - NFE (Non-Financial Entity -- CRS term): active test mirrors NFFE but uses 50% gross income AND 50% gross assets for passive classification
   - Controlling persons: individuals with >= 25% ownership (CRS) or control -- must be reported for passive entities
   - Exempt categories: government entities, international organisations, central banks, broad-participation pension funds, deemed-compliant FFIs
4. **Documentation requirements**:
   - W-8BEN-E: entity classification, treaty claims, FATCA status (Chapter 3 and Chapter 4)

   - Penalties escalate from $5,000 to $400,000 for repeated non-compliance, with strike-off
4. **Luxembourg**: no specific standalone ES legislation, but substance enforced through:
   - Transfer pricing rules: arm's length compensation for functions performed
   - ATAD implementation: CFC rules require substance to avoid income recharacterisation
   - Circular 56bis: minimum substance guidance for holding and financing companies (local qualified staff, local office, local decision-making)
5. **Ireland**: substance established through
   - Central management and control (CMC) test: board of directors meets and makes strategic decisions in Ireland
   - Section 110 SPVs: must have Irish-resident directors, Irish administrator, Irish bank account
   - Transfer pricing substance: Irish employees must perform relevant functions
6. **Multi-jurisdiction comparison**: cost-benefit analysis across candidate jurisdictions
   - Annual substance cost matrix: personnel, office, directors, administration, audit
   - Typical range EUR 50,000-150,000 per annum for adequate substance
   - Optimal jurisdiction selection: minimise substance cost relative to tax benefit, expressed as payback ratio
   - Score > 70 out of 100: compliant; score 50-70: remediation needed; score < 50: high risk
7. **Key benchmarks**: Cayman annual substance cost USD 40-80k; Luxembourg ATAD-compliant holding cost EUR 80-150k; Ireland CMC minimum 2 local directors + quarterly board meetings; payback ratio > 3:1 justifies jurisdiction choice

     - Transaction risk (0-15): regular patterns (5), occasional large (10), frequent cross-border/cash-intensive (15)
   - Composite score determines due diligence level and monitoring frequency
2. **PEP (Politically Exposed Person) classification**:
   - Domestic PEP: heads of state, senior politicians, senior military, judiciary, central bank governors, state enterprise executives
   - Foreign PEP: same categories but in a foreign jurisdiction (generally higher risk)
   - International organisation PEP: senior management of international bodies (UN, IMF, World Bank, etc.)
   - Family members: spouse, children, parents, siblings of a PEP
   - Close associates: known business partners, beneficial owners of legal entities jointly owned with PEP, any person known to have close association
   - De-PEP period: typically 12-24 months after leaving office before risk level can be reassessed downward (FATF minimum 12 months, many jurisdictions apply 24 months)
3. **Due diligence levels**:
   - SDD (Simplified Due Diligence): low-risk customers -- verified identity, simplified ongoing monitoring, no source of wealth required
   - CDD (Customer Due Diligence): standard -- full identity verification, beneficial ownership to 25% threshold, purpose and nature of business relationship, ongoing monitoring
   - EDD (Enhanced Due Diligence): PEP, high-risk countries, complex structures -- senior management approval, source of wealth and funds documentation, enhanced ongoing monitoring, adverse media screening, site visits where appropriate
   - Risk score thresholds: 0-30 = SDD eligible, 31-70 = CDD, >70 = EDD mandatory
   - PEP customers: always EDD regardless of risk score
4. **Sanctions screening**: call `sanctions_screening` with entity names and identifiers
   - Fuzzy matching algorithm: Levenshtein distance-based comparison for name variations, transliterations, and alternative spellings
   - Lists screened: OFAC SDN (US), EU Consolidated List, HMT (UK), UN Security Council, FATF high-risk jurisdictions
   - Match scoring:
     - Exact match (100): identical name, DOB, nationality
     - Strong match (>90): minor spelling variations, matching secondary identifiers
     - Possible match (70-90): phonetic similarity, partial identifier match
     - Weak match (50-70): common name overlap, single identifier match only
   - Disposition: match score >70 requires manual review by compliance officer; >90 requires escalation to MLRO (Money Laundering Reporting Officer)
5. **SAR (Suspicious Activity Report) filing**:
   - Terrorism-related: file within 24 hours of detection
   - Other suspicious activity: file within 30 days of detection (15 days if subject can be identified)
   - Triggers: transactions inconsistent with customer profile, structuring (breaking transactions to avoid thresholds), rapid movement of funds through multiple accounts, transactions with sanctioned jurisdictions
   - Tipping-off prohibition: never inform the customer that a SAR has been or will be filed
6. **Country risk assessment**:
   - Comprehensive embargo: full prohibition on financial services (e.g., OFAC comprehensive sanctions programmes)
   - Sectoral sanctions: restrictions on specific sectors (energy, financial, defence)
   - FATF grey list (increased monitoring): enhanced scrutiny required, not prohibited
   - FATF black list (high-risk third countries): counter-measures may apply, EDD mandatory
7. **Key benchmarks**: risk score >70 = mandatory EDD; PEP always EDD; sanctions match >70 = manual review required; match >90 = MLRO escalation; SAR filing rate typically 0.1-0.5% of customer base annually; average EDD cost USD 500-2,000 per customer; ongoing monitoring review cycle: EDD quarterly, CDD annually, SDD every 3 years
